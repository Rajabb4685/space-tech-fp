        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        
        <ul> 
         <li>What is space technology ? <br>
         Space technology is technology made for space exploration, spaceflights also anything made for the purpose in us or beyond the earth’s atmosphere or in our earth. </li>
         <li>Do you know how much a NASA space suit costs? 
         <br> NASA space suits cost $12,000,000. Space technology is even crucial to our planet. It reduces greenhouse gases emissions with the adaptation of the space technology GPD and semiconductor. </li>
         <li>There are many types of space technology like inventions like websites, apps, machines, devices. </li>
         <li>NASA has a big role in space technology they have invented many space technology some we use daily</li>
         <li>Space technology helped us get more complex in daily use of technology. They are with us all the time. For example, the camera in your phone is a space technology found by NASA</li>
         <li>Currently the space companies are trying to make space traveling more cheap and available. </li>

    <h1>Timeline</h1>
    <h2>Digital Photography</h2>
     <h4>1969</h4>
     <ul>
         <li>
         <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/tech_life_aptina.html">“Digital Photography”</a>  was discovered by NASA.
NASA invented the digital camera in 1969 because they made a picture of space and the camera at the time was very good so Robert Nathan, a scientist at NASA invented the digital camera with a lens, something that all of our phones have. This invention helped NASA take better images and help them get more complex. </li>
<li>
“Whether you take pictures and videos with a DSLR camera or cell phone, or even capture action on the go with a device like a GoPro Hero, you’re using NASA technology. The CMOS active pixel sensor in most digital image-capturing devices was invented when NASA needed to miniaturize cameras for interplanetary missions. It is also widely used in medical imaging and dental X-ray devices.” - NASA </li>

<h2>April 24, 1990</h2>
<h4>Hubble Space Telescope</h4>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html">“Hubble Space Telescope”</a> the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency. </li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope is named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble because he made many discoveries of the expanding universe. This invention played a big role in complexity and discovery in the space field. The Hubble Space Telescope made 1.3 million discoveries since 1990. This invention helps us know that the universe is expanding.</li>

<h2>1991</h2>
<h4>Infrared ear thermometer</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://osr.org/blog/kids/items-we-use-today-originally-invented-for-space/">“Infrared Ear Thermometer”</a>was invented by NASA & Diatek
    </li>
    <li>NASA made this invention so they can take the size of stars and other big objects in space. This invention is something I would say most of us have used because when you go to the doctor they use this in your ear. This invention has been helping a lot in this pandemic taking the temperatures of people. This invention was made in 1991 with NASA and Diatek; it is now available to everyone.

<h2>October 15, 1997</h2>
<h4>Cassini huygen probe (satellite)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html">“Cassini Huygens Probe (Satellite)”</a>was invented by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory & Thales Alenia Space (a french and Italian aerospace manufacturer). 
    </li>
    <li>This invention was a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency to send a space probe to study its rings and natural satellites including planet Saturn and its system. It was invented on October 15, 1997. Its mission was to study and take pictures of Saturn for about 20 years. Check out this website by <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/the-journey/the-spacecraft/">“NASA”</a> it shows the parts of the Cassini Huygens probe. Its visuals are outstanding. </li>

<h2>November 1, 2011</h2>
<h4>Night sky</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-sky/id475772902">“Night Sky”</a>was invented by indie studio iCandi Apps Ltd.
    </li>
    <li>Night Sky was made in 2011. which is a personal planetarium. The app identifies stars, planets, constellations, and satellites in its beautiful planetarium. You can look at even international space stations but search in the app. This was beautifully filled with beautiful space images and nice designs that are easy to use. This app is available in IOS and Android. </li>

<h1>Future Predictions Of Mine In Space Techology</h1>

<p>My first one is a making app where you can view space. I thought of this because there is the internet in space. This app will give you a view of space. It will be to scale because a lot of us have the wrong interpretation of space, especially with the measure and distance of the planet and looks. This app is gonna have :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>This app will have a 360˚ camera that is gonna be alive at all times. </li>
    <li>This app will have videos of old recordings of space. </li>
    <li>The camera will be placed on satellites, for example, one close to the earth, one close to Saturn, and others. </li>
    <li>This app will have timed comments and be available to everyone. </li>
    <li>In this app, you will be allowed to make theories and test them.</li>
